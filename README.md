For Digital Design Onboarding: The task was to create a 32 bit calculator that takes two 32 bit sums and stores them into one single 64 bit sum (using the template files)

For Design Verification: The task was to create a testbench for our 32 bit calculator (using the template files)

For Physical Design: The task was to learn the basics of Physical Design, using tools like Cadence and TCL scripting, and by editing a design of our calculator given to us to ensure it does not have any violations in negative slack or in terms of physical restrictions.

Here are the files that I edited in each of the Onboardings:
    Digital Design:
        adder32.sv
        result_buffer.sv
        controller.sv
        top_lvl.sv
    Design Verification:
        calc_driver.svh
        calc_monitor.svh
        calc_sb.svh
        calc_seq_item.svh
        calc_tb_top.sv
